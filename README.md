## Overview
Shleemypants is not your ordinary auditing tool. This is an interdimensional, time-warping, space-time continuum-defying, slug-weaponizing piece of software genius, named after the one and only immortal and omniscient Time Cop from "Rick and Morty." Just like its namesake, Shleemypants can hop through the virtual annals of time, allowing system administrators to pinpoint any moment in their network's history for a thorough audit. It's like having your very own multidimensional police officer, minus the slug-like creature (sorry, no Chris included).

## Features
* **Time Travel Auditing**: Select any point in your system's history and audit like you've just split time. Perfect for those "Oh geez, when did this happen?" moments.
* **Multiverse Compliance**: Whether you're in Dimension C-137 or just your regular old office, Shleemypants ensures your auditing is up to scratch across all conceivable realities.
* **Slug-Like Precision**: Inspired by Shleemypants' weapon of choice, our tool slithers through your data with the meticulousness of a live, slug-like creature (but much less slimy).
* **Intuitive Interface**: Even a Jerry could use it! Navigate through time and data with ease

## How It Works
Just like Shleemypants confronting Rick about a stolen time crystal, this tool confronts any anomalies in your network's timeline. Simply input the date and time you want to audit, and let Shleemypants do the rest. It'll scan through logs, configurations, and changes made in the system, presenting you with a comprehensive report of what went down, when it went down, and possibly why it went down (assuming it wasn't due to an illegal time experiment).

## Use Cases
* **Catching Time Bandits**: Find out who messed with the server settings last Thursday.
* **Temporal Compliance Checks**: Ensure your network was compliant at any given point in the past, especially if audited by other multidimensional beings.
* **Retroactive Problem Solving**: Identify when a problem started, and by extension, who to blame (or thank, if it's a good thing).
* **Teaching Moments with Morty**: Use past network mistakes as learning opportunities for your intern, Morty.

   - Replace `[options]` with appropriate flags or arguments. For example:
     - To audit a specific date: `python Shleemypants.py --date 20230315`
     - To specify a custom output folder: `python Shleemypants.py --folder=custom_audit_folder`
     - To install required dependencies: `python Shleemypants.py -i`

4. **View the Output**:
   - Shleemypants will display the auditing results in the command line interface.
   - If specified, results will also be saved in the designated output folder.

5. **Additional Options**:
   - Use `python Shleemypants.py --help` for more information on available commands and options.

## What Shleemypants Audits and Copies

The Shleemypants tool performs a comprehensive audit of your system by accessing and copying over various types of data:

* **System Logs**: Shleemypants delves into system logs to extract valuable information about system events, errors, and warnings. This includes but is not limited to application logs, security logs, and system event logs.

* **Configuration Files**: The tool scans through system and application configuration files to detect any changes or anomalies that occurred during the specified audit period.

* **User Activity**: Shleemypants tracks user activity, including login/logout events, file access records, and other user-related actions within the system.

* **Network Traffic Data**: If network monitoring is in place, Shleemypants can analyze network traffic logs to identify unusual patterns or potential security breaches.

* **Installed Software and Updates**: The tool audits installed software and system updates, capturing information about when and what updates or installations were made.

* **Security Settings and Changes**: Shleemypants reviews system security settings, including firewall configurations, antivirus status, and other critical security parameters.

* **File Integrity Checks**: For critical system files and sensitive data, the tool performs integrity checks to ensure no unauthorized modifications have been made.

After completing the audit, Shleemypants compiles this data into a comprehensive report, providing administrators with a detailed overview of the system's status during the selected time frame. The tool's ability to effectively 'travel back in time' ensures that no stone is left unturned in maintaining the integrity and security of your digital universe.

Remember, Shleemypants is powerful but can't actually reverse time, so use it wisely!

## Disclaimer
Shleemypants does not actually manipulate time (we're working on it). Do not attempt to use Shleemypants to solve personal time-related regrets or to win the lottery. Shleemypants is not responsible for any temporal paradoxes, reality collapses, or encounters with fourth-dimensional beings.
