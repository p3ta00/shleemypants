## Overview
Shleemypants is not your ordinary auditing tool. This is an interdimensional, time-warping, space-time continuum-defying, slug-weaponizing piece of software genius, named after the one and only immortal and omniscient Time Cop from "Rick and Morty." Just like its namesake, Shleemypants can hop through the virtual annals of time, allowing system administrators to pinpoint any moment in their network's history for a thorough audit. It's like having your very own multidimensional police officer, minus the slug-like creature (sorry, no Chris included).

## Features
**Time Travel Auditing**: Select any point in your system's history and audit like you've just split time. Perfect for those "Oh geez, when did this happen?" moments.

**Multiverse Compliance**: Whether you're in Dimension C-137 or just your regular old office, Shleemypants ensures your auditing is up to scratch across all conceivable realities.

**Slug-Like Precision**: Inspired by Shleemypants' weapon of choice, our tool slithers through your data with the meticulousness of a live, slug-like creature (but much less slimy).

**Intuitive Interface**: Even a Jerry could use it! Navigate through time and data with ease, no advanced degrees in theoretical physics needed.

## How It Works
Just like Shleemypants confronting Rick about a stolen time crystal, this tool confronts any anomalies in your network's timeline. Simply input the date and time you want to audit, and let Shleemypants do the rest. It'll scan through logs, configurations, and changes made in the system, presenting you with a comprehensive report of what went down, when it went down, and possibly why it went down (assuming it wasn't due to an illegal time experiment).

## Use Cases
### Catching Time Bandits: Find out who messed with the server settings last Thursday.
### Temporal Compliance Checks: Ensure your network was compliant at any given point in the past, especially if audited by other multidimensional beings.
### Retroactive Problem Solving: Identify when a problem started, and by extension, who to blame (or thank, if it's a good thing).
### Teaching Moments with Morty: Use past network mistakes as learning opportunities for your intern, Morty.

## Disclaimer
Shleemypants does not actually manipulate time (we're working on it). Do not attempt to use Shleemypants to solve personal time-related regrets or to win the lottery. Shleemypants is not responsible for any temporal paradoxes, reality collapses, or encounters with fourth-dimensional beings.
